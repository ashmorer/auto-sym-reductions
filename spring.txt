1. Local/Global proofs in Z3, Dafny respectively
2. Express topology in general for some inputs (collapse Ins/Outs to finite structure)
3. Generalize structure of local proofs to global proofs 
4. [buffer]
5. Observe local vs global proof complexity
6. More examples for proof complexity (local vs global)
7. LTL to Buchi conversion
8. [buffer]
9. Leader Election locally - how else to express a local proof - is between(x,y,z) relation sufficient to limit structures to rings
10. Seek leader election resolution - prove can’t be done locally (under some stronger notion of locally) or find local solution
11. CIVL paper
12. [buffer]
13. Seek examples where #quantifiers needed != #equivalence classes
14. If found, explicate. Else, seek proof that n quantifier-proof exists iff n-equivalence class proof exists
15. Spin hash compact


What remains to be done with Liveness -> Safety paper?
Synthesis for fun?
